Just some c code, that tokenizes c code

- Although I see this repo becoming somthing of a 'home base' for my generic code fiddling

## For those who care

Run build.bat to build ctok

- It assumes you are running it from a vs dev cmd prompt (needs _cl_ in path)

Run test.py to run tests

- This test script assumes you have the folowing available in the path

	- git
	- cmake
	- msbuild
	- bcompare

I use visual studio for debugging 
- You can open the exe like it is a project, then save a sln for debugging it
